## About
A platform where women can book an appointment & scan with a clinical specialist without a GP referral and waiting lists. Women can also message clinicians directly in a chatroom & view scan results on their dashboard.

## Purpose
This was the final project we created as part of the bootcamp where we learnt how to work as a team to build an app, had morning stand ups, effectively used branches, merged correctly on Git, resolved conflicts together and brought an idea from inception to a product.

## Challenges
We used javascript for the homepage form to be able to take multiple inputs from a person and narrow down their search based on their location, scan type and body area. This was a hard task to complete and required us to change our DB schema and models twice <img width="1728" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-11 at 20 57 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114405652/224511345-b7fdbb16-a94d-4e5b-9959-7e285fd2a4a0.png">
but we eventually figured it out as a team.

## Next Steps
We absolutely love the design of our homepage and would like to create a mobile version of our app in future as this is currently only available on desktop.
